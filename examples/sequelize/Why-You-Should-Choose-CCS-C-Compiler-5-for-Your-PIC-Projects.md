CCS C Compiler 5 supports all Microchip PIC devices, from 8-bit to 32-bit, and allows you to switch between them easily. You can also use CCS C Compiler 5 with MPLAB X IDE as a plug-in, or with your own preferred editor. CCS C Compiler 5 also integrates with CCS programmers and debuggers, as well as third-party tools, to provide a complete development solution[^2^].
 
CCS C Compiler 5 has many features that make it stand out from other compilers. Some of these features are:
 
- A simple and intuitive syntax that is close to standard C.
- A one-bit data type (short int) that allows the compiler to generate efficient bit-oriented code.
- A comprehensive set of built-in functions that cover common tasks such as LCD, keypad, PWM, serial communication, ADC, DAC, timers, interrupts, EEPROM, SPI, I2C, USB, CAN, LINBus and more[^2^].
- A powerful pre-processor that supports conditional compilation, macros, file inclusion, error handling and PIC-specific commands such as #fuses, #use, #id and #rom.
- An optimizer that reduces code size and improves speed by performing constant folding, dead code elimination, common subexpression elimination, loop unrolling and more.
- A linker that supports multiple memory models, overlays, bank switching and code protection.
- A simulator that allows you to test your code without hardware, with features such as breakpoints, watch variables, single stepping and register view.
- A debugger that supports hardware debugging with CCS programmers and debuggers, as well as software debugging with the simulator.
- An editor that provides syntax highlighting, auto-completion, code folding, project management and more.

CCS C Compiler 5 is constantly updated with new devices, added driver libraries, new applications examples and features. The latest version is 5.115 which was released on March 3rd 2023[^3^]. Some of the new features in this version are:

- Support for LINBus protocol integrated into #use rs232() function[^1^].
- Support for read\_device\_info() and read\_config\_info() functions for PIC16F184xx family[^1^].
- Fixed issues with some functions such as pin\_select(), setup\_ccp(), dac\_write() and more[^1^].
